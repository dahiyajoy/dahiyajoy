Working as a Software Engineer, I am actively involved in projects that utilizes Machine Learning Models by creating data
regression models, using predictive data modeling, data processing and data mining algorithms along with experience in Azure-
Based Data Automation alongside RPA tools such as Automation Anywhere 360 and Power Automate. I expertise in Python
programming, Predictive Modeling, Clustering Techniques, Deep learning techniques, utilizing IQ Bots, Document Automation Bots,
Scripting (VBScript and Python) to extract data and Creating Interactive Dashboards to visualize the data using Microsoft Power BI.
Deploying Al-Driven Robotic Solutions to automate various business processes effectively, I additionally excel in Robust Workflow
Creation and Solution Delivery. These experiences have honed my technical skills in problem solving and instilled a strong work
ethic.
